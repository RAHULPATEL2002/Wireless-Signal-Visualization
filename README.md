# Wireless-Signal-Visualization
MATLAB code for Wireless System LAB 01 (UI22EC58) focused on plotting and analyzing continuous and discrete signals. Includes visualization of signal types like sine, cosine, square, sawtooth, and exponential waves. The lab helps in understanding signal behavior and applying various plotting operations for signal processing tasks.
# SignalPlotter-UI22EC58

## Project Overview
This project is part of LAB 01 for the course UI22EC58, aimed at understanding and plotting various types of continuous and discrete signals using MATLAB. The repository demonstrates how to work with different signal types such as sine waves, cosine waves, square waves, and exponential signals, along with plotting operations.

## Features
- Plotting continuous and discrete signals
- Visualization of various signal types including sine, cosine, square, sawtooth, and exponential signals
- Demonstrates signal analysis using MATLAB's built-in functions

## Signal Types Covered
1. **Continuous Signal** - A smooth, continuous sine wave
2. **Discrete Signal** - A sampled version of the sine wave
3. **Sine Wave** - A periodic waveform fundamental to signal processing
4. **Cosine Wave** - Another periodic waveform, phase-shifted from the sine wave
5. **Square Wave** - A waveform with two levels of amplitude
6. **Sawtooth Wave** - A waveform that rises upwards and then sharply drops
7. **Exponential Signal** - An exponentially growing signal

## MATLAB Code
The MATLAB code plots all the signal types mentioned above, using simple `plot` and `stem` functions to visualize continuous and discrete signals respectively.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RAHULPATEL2002/Wireless-Signal-Visualization.git
Open the MATLAB script in your MATLAB environment.
Usage
Run the script LAB01_UI22EC58.m in MATLAB to generate and visualize the signals.
